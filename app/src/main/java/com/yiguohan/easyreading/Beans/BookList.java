Method、Singleton，Command、Adapter、Facade、TemplateMethod、Iterator、Composite、State、Proxy。最后三章比较特别。第12章介绍如何将两个以上的设计模式结合起来成为新的设计模式(例如著名的MVC模式)，作者称其为复合设计模式(这是作者自创的名称，并非四人组的标准名词)，第13章介绍如何进一步学习设计模式，如何发觉新的设计模式等主题，至于第14章则很快地浏览尚未介绍的设计模式，包括Bridge、Builder、Chain of Responsibility、Flyweight、Interpreter、Mediator、Memento、Prototype，Visitor。第1章还介绍了四个○○基本概念(抽象、封装、继承、多态)，而第1章到第9章也陆续介绍了九个○○原则(Principle)。千万不要轻视这些○○原则，因为每个设计模式背后都包含了几个○○原则的概念。很多时候，在设计时有两难的情况，这时候我们必须回归到○○原则，以方便判断取舍。可以这么说：○○原则是我们的目标，而设计模式是我们的做法。","series":{"id":"10044","title":"O'Reilly深入浅出系列"},"price":"98.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":791,"average":"8.9","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Elisabeth

.\n《深入浅出HTML与CSS、XHTML》能让你避免认为Web-safe颜色还是紧要问题的尴尬，以及不明智地把标记放入你的页面。最大的好处是，你将毫无睡意地学习HTML、XHTML 和CSS。如果你曾经读过深入浅出（Head First）系列图书中的任一本，就会知道书中展现的是什么：一个按人脑思维方式设计的丰富的可视化学习模式。本书的编写采用了许多最新的研究，包括神经生物学、认知科学以及学习理论，这使得本书能让HTML和CSS深深地烙印在你的脑海里。 ..\n学会创建Web页面的真正诀窍，并认识到为什么你的老板所说的关于HTML表格的一切都有可能是错误的（以及做什么来代替）。最重要的是，在鸡尾酒会上当你的同事随口提及他的HTML现在如何完整以及他的CSS是在外部样式表里时，你表示认同，这会给酒会客人留下深刻的印象。...","series":{"id":"10044","title":"O'Reilly深入浅出系列"},"price":"79.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":814,"average":"8.8","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Kathy

Something more complex. Something more fun.  You want to learn about the patterns that matter--why to use them, when to use them, how to use them (and when NOT to use them). But you don't just want to see how patterns look in a book, you want to know how they look \"in the wild\". In their native environment. In other words, in real world applications. You also want to learn how patterns are used in the Java API, and how to exploit Java's built-in pattern support in your own code.  You want to learn the real OO design principles and why everything your boss told you about inheritance might be wrong (and what to do instead). You want to learn how those principles will help the next time you're up a creek without a design paddle pattern.  Most importantly, you want to learn the \"secret language\" of Design Patterns so that you can hold your own with your co-worker (and impress cocktail party guests) when he casually mentions his stunningly clever use of Command, Facade, Proxy, and Factory in between sips of a martini. You'll easily counter with your deep understanding of why Singleton isn't as simple as it sounds, how the Factory is so often misunderstood, or on the real relationship between Decorator, Facade and Adapter.  With Head First Design Patterns, you'll avoid the embarrassment of thinking Decorator is something from the \"Trading Spaces\" show. Best of all, in a way that won't put you to sleep! We think your time is too important (and too short) to spend it struggling with academic texts.  If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect - a visually-rich format designed for the way your brain works. Using the latest research in neurobiology, cognitive science, and learning theory, Head First Design Patterns will load patterns into your brain in a way that sticks. In a way that lets you put them to work immediately. In a way that makes you better at solving software design problems, and better at speaking the language of patterns with others on your team.","series":{"id":"4033","title":"Head First"},"price":"USD 49.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":363,"average":"9.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Eric T Freeman","Elisabeth Freeman","Elisabeth Robson"],"pubdate":"2005-12-18","tags":[{"count":190,"name":"html","title":"html"},{"count":178,"name":"css","title":"css"},{"count":106,"name":"web","title":"web"},{"count":98,"name":"XHTML","title":"XHTML"},{"count":73,"name":"计算机","title":"计算机"},{"count":66,"name":"HeadFirst","title":"HeadFirst"},{"count":44,"name":"O'Reilly","title":"O'Reilly"},{"count":29,"name":"技术","title":"技术"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com/mpic/s4228152.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"658","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com/spic/s4228152.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com/lpic/s4228152.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com/mpic/s4228152.jpg"},"alt":"https://book.douban.com/subject/1472137/","id":"1472137","publisher":"O'Reilly Media","isbn10":"059610197X","isbn13":"9780596101978","title":"Head First HTML with CSS & XHTML","url":"https://api.douban.com/v2/book/1472137","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Tired of reading HTML books that only make sense after you're an expert?

His books on computer programming, home theater, and analysis and design have sold in excess of 100,000 copies. He has been writing, editing, and producing technical books for nearly a decade, and is as comfortable in front of a word processor as he is behind a guitar, chasing his two sons and his daughter around the house, or laughing at reruns of Arrested Development with his wife.\nBrett spends most of his time these days on cognitive theory, codifying and expanding on the learning principles that shaped the Head First series into a bestselling phenomenon. He's curious about how humans best learn, why Star Wars was so formulaic and still so successful, and is adamant that a good video game is the most effective learning paradigm we have.\nGary Pollice\nGary Pollice is a self-labeled curmudgeon (that's a crusty, ill- tempered, usually old man) who spent over 35 years in industry trying to figure out what he wanted to be when he grew up. Even though he hasn't grown up yet, he did make the move in 2003 to the hallowed halls of academia where he has been corrupting the minds of the next generation of software developers with radical ideas like, \"develop software for your customer, learn how to work as part of a team, design and code quality and elegance and correctness counts, and it's okay to be a nerd as long as you are a great one.\" Gary is also a co-author of Head First Object-Oriented Analysis and Design.Gary is a Professor of Practice (meaning he had a real job before becoming a professor) at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. He went to WPI because he was so impressed with the WPI graduates that he's worked with over the years. He lives in central Massachusetts with his wife, Vikki, and their two dogs, Aloysius and Ignatius. When not working on geeky things he ... well he's always working on geeky things. You can see what he's up to by visiting his WPI home page at http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~gpollice/. Feel free to drop him a note and complain or cheer about the book.\nDavid West\nDavid West would like to describe himself as sheik geek. Unfortunately no one else would describe him in that way. They would say he is a professional Englishman who likes to talk about software development best practices with the passion and energy of an evangelical preacher. Recently Dave has moved to Ivar Jacobson Consulting, where he runs the Americas and can combine his desire to talk about software development and spread the word on rugby and football, and argue that cricket is more exciting that baseball.Before running the Americas for Ivar Jacobson Consulting, Dave worked for a number of years at Rational Software (now a part of IBM). Dave held many positions at Rational and then IBM, including Product Manager for RUP where he introduced the idea of process plug-ins and agility to RUP. Dave still laments the days when he use to sit in a cube and write software in the city of London. This is where he believes he cut his teeth writing big insurance systems with nothing but a green screen and a process flow chart.\nDave can be contacted at dwest@ivarjacobson.com, and if he is not with customers or drinking warm beer with his friends in Boston, he will email you back.","summary":"\"Head First Object Oriented Analysis and Design\" is a refreshing look at subject of OOAD. What sets this book apart is its focus on learning. The authors have made the content of OOAD accessible, usable for the practitioner.\" - Ivar Jacobson, Ivar Jacobson Consulting. \"I just finished reading \"HF OOA&D\" and I loved it! The thing I liked most about this book was its focus on why we do OOA&D - to write great software!\" - Kyle Brown, Distinguished Engineer, IBM. \"Hidden behind the funny pictures and crazy fonts is a serious, intelligent, extremely well-crafted presentation of OO Analysis and Design. As I read the book, I felt like I was looking over the shoulder of an expert designer who was explaining to me what issues were important at each step, and why.\" - Edward Sciore, Associate Professor, Computer Science Department, Boston College. Tired of reading Object Oriented Analysis and Design books that only makes sense after you're an expert? You've heard OOA&D can help you write great software every time-software that makes your boss happy, your customers satisfied and gives you more time to do what makes you happy. But how? \"Head First Object-Oriented Analysis & Design\" shows you how to analyze, design, and write serious object-oriented software: software that's easy to reuse, maintain, and extend; software that doesn't hurt your head; software that lets you add new features without breaking the old ones. Inside you will learn how to: use OO principles like encapsulation and delegation to build applications that are flexible; apply the Open-Closed Principle (OCP) and the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) to promote reuse of your code; leverage the power of design patterns to solve your problems more efficiently; and, use UML, use cases, and diagrams to ensure that all stakeholders are communicating clearly to help you deliver the right software that meets everyone's needs. By exploiting how your brain works, \"Head First OOA&D\" compresses the time it takes to learn and retain complex information.

Upon discovering that technical book writing actually paid real money, she learned to accept and enjoy it. After going back to school to get a Masters in Computer Science, she worked for the acronyms NRL and LANL. Then she discovered Flash, and wrote her first bestseller. A victim of bad timing, she moved to Silicon Valley just before the great crash. She spent several years working for Yahoo! and writing other books and training courses. Finally giving in to her creative writing bent, she moved to the New York area to get an MFA in Creative Writing.

It means that you have the knowledge to solve most common project problems, and proves that you know your stuff. Once you're certified, your projects are more likely to succeed because you have the skills and knowledge to make them successful. Not only that, it can mean a better job, more money, and greater respect from your peers. But studying for a difficult four-hour exam on project management isn't easy, even for experienced project managers. You want to remember everything that you're learning about project management, but your brain is working against you! Your brain craves novelty, and most PMP certification prep books are anything but novel. When you keep putting down a boring book instead of studying, it's because your brain doesn't think the information in it is worth learning. Your brain has more important stuff to think about, like how to keep you alive and out of danger - and it doesn't think that failing the PMP exam qualifies as life-threatening! So how do you trick your brain into thinking that your life does depend on learning everything you need to know to pass the PMP Exam? \"Head First PMP\" is the answer!  Using the latest research in neurobiology, cognitive science and learning theory, \"Head First PMP\" has a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works - a multi-sensory experience that helps the material stick, not a text-heavy approach that puts you to sleep. \"Head First PMP\" offers 100 per cent coverage of \"The PMBOK[registered] Guide\" principles and certification objectives in a way that's engaging, not tedious. This book helps you prepare for the PMP certification exam with a unique method that goes beyond answers to specific questions and makes you think about the big picture of project management. By putting project management concepts into context, you will be able to understand, remember, and apply them-not just on the exam, but also on the job. With \"Head First PMP\", you get the best of both worlds: a thorough and effective preparation guide for the PMP certification exam with hundreds of practice questions and exam strategies, along with puzzles, games, problems, exercises and the unique Head First approach that makes learning easy and entertaining.

Upon discovering that technical book writing actually paid real money, she learned to accept and enjoy it. After going back to school to get a Masters in Computer Science, she worked for the acronyms NRL and LANL. Then she discovered Flash, and wrote her first bestseller. A victim of bad timing, she moved to Silicon Valley just before the great crash. She spent several years working for Yahoo! and writing other books and training courses. Finally giving in to her creative writing bent, she moved to the New York area to get an MFA in Creative Writing. Her Head First-style thesis was delivered to a packed room of professors and fellow students. It was extremely well received, and she finished her degree, finished Head First SQL, and can't wait to begin her next book.\nLynn loves traveling, cooking, and making up elaborate background stories about complete strangers. She's a little scared of clowns.\nMichael Morrison is a writer, developer, toy inventor, and author of books on Java, Web scripting, game development, and mobile devices.

You might think the problem is your brain. It seems to have a mind of its own, a mind that doesn't always want to take in the dry, technical stuff you're forced to study.\nThe fact is your brain craves novelty. It's constantly searching, scanning, waiting for something unusual to happen. After all, that's the way it was built to help you stay alive. It takes all the routine, ordinary, dull stuff and filters it to the background so it won't interfere with your brain's real work--recording things that matter. How does your brain know what matters? It's like the creators of the Head First approach say, suppose you're out for a hike and a tiger jumps in front of you, what happens in your brain? Neurons fire. Emotions crank up. Chemicals surge.\nThat's how your brain knows.\nAnd that's how your brain will learn Java. Head First Java combines puzzles, strong visuals, mysteries, and soul-searching interviews with famous Java objects to engage you in many different ways. It's fast, it's fun, and its effective. And, despite its playful appearance, Head First Java is serious stuff: a complete introduction to object-oriented programming and Java. You'll learn everything from the fundamentals to advanced topics, including threads, network sockets, and distributed programming with RMI. And the new. second edition focuses on Java 5.0, the latest version of the Java language and development platform. Because Java 5.0 is a major update to the platform, with deep, code-level changes, even more careful study and implementation is required. So learning the Head First way is more important than ever.\nIf you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect--a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works. If you haven't, you're in for a treat. You'll see why people say it's unlike any other Java book you've ever read.\nBy exploiting how your brain works, Head First Java compresses the time it takes to learn and retain--complex information. Its unique approach not only shows you what you need to know about Java syntax, it teaches you to think like a Java programmer. If you want to be bored, buy some other book. But if you want to understand Java, this book's for you.","price":"USD 44.95"}]
